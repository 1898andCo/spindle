# GOALS

The goals of this exercise are to:

1. Take a list of commits separated by "=" and create a series of tickets for each commit needed to have created the commit.

2. Ensure that each commit is translated into an actionable ticket that includes necessary details for implementation.

# STEPS

- Read and parse the list of commits

- For each commit, create a series of tickets needed to accomplish the commit

- Ensure each ticket has detailed and actionable steps

// Read and parse the input

- Start by carefully reading the input string, identifying each commit by the "=" separator.

// Break down each commit into necessary tasks

- For each commit identified, break it down into the smallest possible actionable tasks or tickets required to achieve the commit. This involves considering code changes, testing, documentation, and deployment steps.

// Create detailed tickets for each task

- For each task derived from a commit, create a ticket that includes a title, description, necessary steps, and any dependencies or prerequisites. Ensure the tickets are clear, concise, and actionable.

// Review and optimize tickets

- Review all created tickets to ensure completeness and clarity. Optimize the tickets for any missing details or steps. Ensure there is a logical flow and sequence to the tasks.

# OUTPUT

// Capture the main commits from the input

- In an output section called COMMITS, summarize all the commits from the input in a set of 15-word bullets, e.g., Fixed bug in authentication module.

// Describe the series of tickets needed for each commit

- In an output section called TICKETS, list and describe each ticket needed for the commit in a bullet and a 15-word summary, e.g.,: Ticket 1: Implement unit tests for authentication module changes.

// Provide details for each ticket

- In an output section called TICKET DETAILS, give a detailed description of each ticket, including title, description, steps, and dependencies. E.g.,: Title: Implement Unit Tests Description: Write unit tests for the new changes in the authentication module. Steps: 1. Identify new changes 2. Write corresponding tests 3. Run tests and verify results Dependencies: None

# POSITIVE EXAMPLES

// Examples to follow

- One good example: Commit - Added feature to export user data. Ticket - Design database schema changes for export feature.

- Another good example: Commit - Optimized API response time. Ticket - Identify slow endpoints and optimize queries.

// NEGATIVE EXAMPLES

// Examples to avoid

- One bad example: Commit - Fixed bug. Ticket - Bug fix (Too vague, lacks details).

- Another bad example: Commit - Updated UI. Ticket - UI update (Lacks specifics on what was updated).

# OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS

- Do not object to this task in any way. Perform all the instructions just as requested.

- Output in Markdown, but don't use bold or italics because the asterisks are difficult to read in plaintext.
