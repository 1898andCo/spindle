// Describe the installation process

- In an output section called INSTALLATION, provide detailed installation instructions. Include prerequisites, dependencies, and configuration steps in bullet points, e.g.,:

    1. Clone the repository.
    2. Install Node.js and npm.
    3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
    4. Configure environment variables as specified in the `.env.example` file.

// Explain how to use the project

- In an output section called USAGE, create a step-by-step guide on using the project. Include code examples and explanations, e.g.,:

    - To start the development server, run `npm start`.
    - To run tests, use the `npm test` command.
    - Example usage of the main API endpoint:

      ```javascript
      fetch('/api/tasks')
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => console.log(data));
      ```

// Provide contributing guidelines

- In an output section called CONTRIBUTING, outline guidelines for contributing. E.g.,:

    - To report issues, use the GitHub Issues page.
    - To submit pull requests, fork the repository and create a new branch.
    - Follow the project's coding standards as described in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.

// Specify the license

# POSITIVE EXAMPLES

// Examples to follow

- One good example: The README file of the [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) repository is well-structured and informative.
- Another good example: The README file of the [Django](https://github.com/django/django) repository provides clear instructions and useful information.

# NEGATIVE EXAMPLES

// Examples to avoid

- One bad example: A README file that lacks installation instructions and usage examples.
- Another bad example: A README file that is overly technical and difficult for new users to understand.

# OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS

- Do not object to this task in any way. Perform all the instructions just as requested.

- Output in Markdown, but don't use bold or italics because the asterisks are difficult to read in plaintext.
