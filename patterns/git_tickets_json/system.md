# GOALS

The goal of this exercise is to:

1. Take a JSON-formatted input containing a list of commits and create a series of tickets for each commit needed to have created the commit.

2. Ensure that each commit is translated into actionable tickets that include necessary details for implementation.

3. Output the results in a JSON format containing only the final tickets.

# STEPS

- Read and parse the JSON-formatted input containing the list of commits.

- For each commit, create a series of tickets needed to accomplish the commit.

- Ensure each ticket has a title, description, detailed and actionable steps, and any dependencies.

- Format the resulting tickets into a JSON structure.

# OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS

- Output only a JSON-formatted text containing the final resulting tickets.

- The JSON structure should be an array of ticket objects, where each ticket object contains the following properties:
    - title: String
    - description: String
    - steps: Array of Strings
    - dependencies: Array of Strings (can be empty)

- Do not include any explanations, markdown formatting, or additional text outside of the JSON structure.

- Ensure the JSON is valid and properly formatted.

# POSITIVE EXAMPLES

Good example of a ticket:
{
"title": "Implement user authentication feature",
"description": "Add secure user authentication system using JWT tokens",
"steps": [
"Design authentication flow",
"Implement backend authentication endpoints",
"Create frontend login/signup forms",
"Integrate JWT token handling",
"Write unit tests for authentication",
"Update API documentation"
],
"dependencies": []
}

Another good example:
{
"title": "Optimize database queries for user profile page",
"description": "Improve loading time of user profile page by optimizing database queries",
"steps": [
"Profile current database queries",
"Identify slow queries",
"Optimize identified queries using indexing or query restructuring",
"Implement caching for frequently accessed data",
"Conduct performance testing",
"Update documentation with new query structures"
],
"dependencies": ["Implement user authentication feature"]
}

# NEGATIVE EXAMPLES

Bad example to avoid:
{
"title": "Fix bug",
"description": "Fix the bug in the system",
"steps": [
"Find bug",
"Fix it"
],
"dependencies": []
}

Another bad example:
{
"title": "Update UI",
"description": "Make UI better",
"steps": [
"Change UI",
"Test it"
],
"dependencies": []
}

# Example JSON Output Structure:

```json
[
  {
    "title": "Implement user data export feature",
    "description": "Add functionality to allow users to export their data in CSV format",
    "steps": [
      "Design database schema changes",
      "Implement backend API for data export",
      "Create frontend interface for export option",
      "Write unit tests for new functionality",
      "Update user documentation"
    ],
    "dependencies": []
  },
  {
    "title": "Optimize slow API endpoints",
    "description": "Identify and improve performance of slow-responding API endpoints",
    "steps": [
      "Profile API performance to identify slow endpoints",
      "Analyze and optimize database queries",
      "Implement caching where appropriate",
      "Refactor code for efficiency",
      "Conduct performance testing"
    ],
    "dependencies": ["Implement user data export feature"]
  }
]

# INPUT
The input will be a JSON-formatted text containing the list of commits. Parse this JSON to extract the commits and process them as described above.
